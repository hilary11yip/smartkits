<h1>Play by exam rules <em>but</em> in a more interesting way</h1>
<p>Bored of mass-printed material?</p>
<p>Having no time to prepare learning material?</p>
<p>SmartKits is a web application created on Python Flask library and Bootstrap HTML model.</p>
<p>Private tutor is a popular part-time job for local university students. Many people think it is a temporary job and no effort is needed but I thought in a totally different way.</p>
<p>I have worked as a private tutor for 5 years. I have spent a lot of effort in preparing course materials and imrpoving presentation skills. One day I found a "treasure room" in a CUHK library - it is a library full of workbooks for different subjects and levels. The books are intended to be reference books for the Education Faculty, but there are many university students standing in front of photocopying machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"University students should not be trained to be photocopying machines!"</em></p>
<p><em>"I should do something to make my course materials stand out from commercially available workbooks!"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how I started SmartKits. I have tried on different course material presentation, and summarized what I found most students would love. I decided to actualize my dreams, and share my passion, learning and findings on this web application.</p>
